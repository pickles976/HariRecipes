### Recipe Scraping basics

There are two ways I know that you can tell if a url is a valid recipe:

1. The url prefix is known to correspond to a recipe. For example if a url has the prefix https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/ 
2. Look for script tags with type "application/ld+json". These script tags should have a schema in the class that matches a commonly-used recipe schema like "allrecipes-schema"

Scraping by prefix-url is much faster, because you don't actually need to visit the link to know that it is a recipe. However for most websites, just a link prefix is not enough. In this case we need to rely on the metadata, which looks like this:

```html
<script id="allrecipes-schema_1-0" class="comp allrecipes-schema mntl-schema-unified" type="application/ld+json">[
{
"@context": "http://schema.org",
"@type": ["Recipe"]
,"headline": "One Pan Chicken Gnocchi"
,"datePublished": "2024-05-29T13:44:45.890-04:00"
,"dateModified": "2024-05-29T13:44:45.890-04:00"
,"author": [
{"@type": "Person"
,"name": "TheDailyGourmet"
,"url": "https://www.allrecipes.com/thedailygourmet-7113600"
}
]</script>
```

This script will have a recipe metadata class, and the inner text will be a list of ld+json, typically the first of which has `"@type"` of `["Recipe"]`, as well as some other tags sometimes.
