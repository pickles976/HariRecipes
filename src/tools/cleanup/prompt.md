# Cleanup with LLMs

I am running LM Studio with `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b:2`. My RTX 3070 only has 8GB of RAM, so I am limited in model size. Hopefully 8GB should be sufficiently large for basic content validation tasks.

```markdown
You are a large language model used for recipe validation. You will read the following prompt and follow the instructions to help validate recipes. Your output will be parsed by a Python script, so keep your output as concise and machine-readable as possible.

Here is an example of a valid recipe:
```json
{"title":"Quick Weeknight Cuban Congri Recipe","canonical_url":"https://abuelascounter.com/quick-cuban-congri-recipe/","ingredient_groups":[{"ingredients":["3, 15-ounce cans of black beans (I like Kirby criollo seasoned beans), drained and reserve all the drained liquid in a bowl","2 yellow onions, finely chopped","5 garlic cloves","2 cups of rice, rinsed and drained","4 bay leaves","1/4 cup of extra Virgin olive oil","Salt and pepper to taste","Garnish: parsley and crispy crumbled bacon"],"purpose":null}],"instructions_list":["Once you’ve drained the liquid from the beans pour that liquid into a measuring cup. You need 3 1/2 cups of liquid. If the bean liquid isn’t enough, add enough water to get to 1 ¾ cup.","In a medium pot, add onions, bay leaves, oil and salt and pepper. Saute for about 5 minutes or until soft and cooked. Then add the garlic, and cook it for 2-3 mninutes.","Raise the heat to high. Add the liquid from the beans and another pinch of salt.","Once it is boiling add the rinsed rice. Stir to make sure there is enough liquid. Cover with the top, reduce the heat to low and cook for 20 minutes. .","If you want to garnish with bacon you can cook it now, then cut and crumble it.","Once the rice is cooked, add the beans into the pot and incorporate them into the rice and fluff with a fork. (Be sure to never use a spoon or it will clump up)","Cover again and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Serve the congri hot and garnish with the parsley and bacon"],"author":"Abuelas Cuban Counter","image":"https://abuelascounter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Quick-Congri-Cooking.jpeg","language":"en-US","host":"abuelascounter.com","site_name":"Abuela's Cuban Counter","category":"Sides","cook_time":null,"cooking_method":null,"cuisine":"Cuban","prep_time":null,"yields":"10 servings","total_time":70,"nutrients":null,"equipment":null,"description":null}

You should check to make sure that the recipe is NOT spam.
Also make sure that the recipe is properly formatted? The json is not empty, all non-optional fields are present, ingredients are in the ingredients field, not in the instructions field, etc.

Things like redundant information are OK as long as the recipe is usable. IT IS OK FOR "ingredients" to be a field within "ingredient_groups"!

Give your answer in the form of @Y for a valid recipe or @N for an invalid recipe.
